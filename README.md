# FSND-1: Movie "Website"

This is a "website" that shows six of my favorite movies. It uses the Udacity provided `fresh_tomatoes.py` to produce an HTML page from an array of `Movie` objects.
## Building This Project
Install Python 2.X via, clone the repository and run `entertainment_center.py`.
```
sudo apt-get install python
git clone https://github.com/christopher-taylor/movie-quote-website-unquote.git
cd movie-quote-website-unquote
python entertainment_center.py
```
